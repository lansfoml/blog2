            <div style="width: 50%;">
                <p>Today we will once again be going over some javascript and specifically the aspects of drawing and 
                    moving items. There should be a canvas to the left of this paragraph with a ball bouncing around 
                    inside of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to create something like this you need to create a canvas using the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
                     tag. After creating the canvas in your script tag you should make a variable that gets the canvas
                     you just made doing something like <code>var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");</code>
                </p>

                <p>Now that you have your canvas you are going to want to draw something on it. In order to do this you must 
                    use the HTMLCanvasElement.getContext() method which returns a drawing context on the canvas, or 
                    null if the context identifier is not supported. The parameter that we used in getContext() was "2d",
                    2d allows you to create 2d objects on the canvas. To draw this circle we see bouncing around, we use: <br> 
                    <code>varName.arc(x, y, ballRadius, 0, Math.PI*2);</code> <br> Where the x parameter is the 
                    horizontal coordinate of the arc's center, the y parameter is the vertical coordinate of the arc's,
                    ballRadius is the radius of the circle, and the Math.PI*2 makes it a circle. With this variable you 
                    can also make other shapes like rectangles and triangles as well.
                     
                </p>
                <p>Keeping the ball within the given canvas takes a little bit of math to calculate it correctly. 
                    We do this by checking:<br> <code>if(x + dx > canvas.width-ballRadius || x + dx &gt; ballRadius) { <br>
                        &emsp;dx = -dx;<br>
                    }</code> <br> which checks if the position is within the canvas broders as well as including the balls radius in
                     that as well.
