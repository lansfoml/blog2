            If I were teaching CS347 next semester I have two ideas for the class. The first would be to 
            split the class into two different classes. One class would be a deeper dive into HTML 
            and mainly CSS as there is so much you can do with both of these two languages and I feel 
            as if we just grazed the surface. The other idea would be to spend way less time with HTML 
            and instead spend more time with javascript and the react stuff we did. I did enjoy the labs and 
            think they were helpful in my learning, but maybe just make the labs for javascript and react split 
            up more or start touching on those topics earlier in the semester, as I feel we were thrown into the fire with these.
