<p style="width:500px;">Whenever I begin to learn a new coding language, i typically end up going to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.com</a> an awful lot. 
    This instance was no different and this site helped me learn a lot. To begin with, what I learned, I'll start with my perception of HTML. HTML to me is
 a language used to build websites, specifically pertaining to the structure, layout, and elements of a page. 
I learned that HTML leaves a lot of the fancy styling and other aspects to CSS and Javascript. HTML defines the aspects 
of the page with "tags", for example, the "h1" tag surrounded by "<>" classifies whatever is inside as a header. 
For example at the top of this page, "My fist blog" is inside the h2 tag.</p>



<p style="width:500px;"> This post I have incorporated a couple different tags that HTML provides including <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">links</a> (href), 
    images, (img), paragraphs (p), headings (h), and other HTML attributes. Some basic attributes that most if not all 
HTML files use is the "!DOCTYPE html" at the top of eahc page. Most HTML pages also include a header, footer, body, and main section.</p>
