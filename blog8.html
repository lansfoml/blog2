            This week we will be covering content management systems, specifically what they are and the 
            advantages and disadvantages of using them. A content management system (CMS) is a program 
            that allows many contributors to generate, update, and publish web content. In a CMS, content is 
            typically saved in a database and displayed using a collection of templates in a presentation layer. 
            Essentially they are drag and drop or simple designs for websites. So if you don't want to use HTML, 
            CSS, or Javascript to create your own website from scratch you can use one of these systems.

            The collaborative nature of a CMS is a significant benefit. Multiple users can log in and contribute, 
            schedule, or control published material. A CMS can be accessed from anywhere by any number of users 
            because the interface is usually browser-based. The second main benefit of a CMS is that it enables 
            non-technical persons who are unfamiliar with programming languages to generate and manage their own 
            web content. A common content management platform's drag-and-drop editors allow users to enter text 
            and upload images without needing to know HTML or CSS. Leading to another benefit of the time you 
            save by not needing to learn these languages or deal with the hardships and errors that come with coding.

            One major disadvantage of using a content management system is that it is not usually 
            fully customizable or not as customizable as if you wrote your site in HTML or CSS on your own. 
            Most of the time they have specific templates or features already implemented in their CMS. If 
            these features don't fit your specific needs then there is not much you can do about it. Another 
            disadvantage of using a CMS is that you typically have to pay for them, whereas writing or creating 
            your own can be free.
