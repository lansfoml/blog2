            This week we will be covering content management systems, specifically what they are and the advantages and 
            disadvantages of using them. A content management system (CMS) is a program that allows many contributors to 
            generate, update, and publish web content. In a CMS, content is typically saved in 
            a database and displayed using a collection of templates in a presentation layer. Essentially
            they are drag and drop or simple designs for websites. So if you don't want to use HTML, CSS, or
            Javascript to create your own website from scratch you can use one of these systems.

            The collaborative nature of a CMS is a significant benefit. Multiple users can log 
            in and contribute, schedule, or control published material. A CMS can be accessible 
            from anywhere by any number of users because the interface is usually browser-based.
            The second main benefit of a CMS is that it enables non-technical persons who are 
            unfamiliar with programming languages to generate and manage their own web content. 
            A common content management platform's drag-and-drop editors allow users to enter text and upload 
            images without needing to know HTML or CSS.
