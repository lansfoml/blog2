    <h1>Week 3 Blog post</h1>
    <h2>September, 15, 2021</h2>

    <p>
        This week we learned about a new way to control the flow of your page and have more control over what your
        child elements are doing called flexbox. Flexbox specifically gives you control over your direction,
        distribution, alignment, and expanison. The first element we are going ot talk about is direction. When you
        decide top use flexbox is tarts off with the direction in row. You can change it to be a column by doing: <span
        style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier">flex-direction: column;</span> as shown below.
        
    </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div> <img src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/row.png" alt="pic of flexbox row" width="700px"></div>
        <div> <img src="https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/column.png" alt="pic of flexbox column" height="300px"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The next thing flexbox allows you to do is manage the sapcing between the items in your flexbox. This is done by the justify-content
        element. There are many different things you can do with justify-content including start, center, space-between, space-around,
        sapce-evenly and more. Personally I like to use the cetner and sapce-evenly elements as they can cetner the content 
        or space the items evenly for a clean look. The pictures below show some examples of what you can do with justify content.
    </p>

    <div class="container" >
        <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/434/1*iigDGiNFBOUVJQ_07C1B2g.png" 
            alt="pic of justify content" width="200px" height="200px"></div>
        <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"> 
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container/align5.png" 
            alt="pic of justify content as well" width="500px" height="200px"></div>
        </div>

        <p>Another way to manage the spacing and layout of items in your flexbox would be using the align-items element. The align-items
            element is similar to the justify content element as it moves your items into the alignment that fits your needs. With align-items
            you can do things like flex-start, flex-end, cetner, baseline, and stretch. The image below shows example of what align-items can do.
