        <p>Besides just using simple HTML to create a webpage, we also would like to make
            the webpage look good to draw users in. In order to do this we would use CSS or Cascading Style Sheet
            to add some flare to our page. CSS is also helpful for improving the layout and design of the page. For example this paragrpah 
            is centered and has 25px of padding to the left and to the right. <span style="color: aquamarine;"> It can also make this sentence 
            any color we want, including aquamarine <span style="color: tomato;"> or tomato.</span>.</span> The text box or border that is surrounding 
            all these paragraphs as well as the balck background and white text also comes from CSS.

        <p>This week we lerned about CSS and the many features of it. However, it  can be 
            implemented in a couple of different ways. In this blog we will go over a couple different ways 
            to use it in your actual code. The first way we will go over is called inline style. This first example 
            and image comes from <a style="color: chartreuse;" href="https://careerkarma.com/blog/css-inline/">careerkarma.com</a>
        </p>

        <img style="padding-left: 5px;" src="/Screen Shot 2021-09-07 at 4.41.05 PM.png" alt="screenshot of inline style code">
        

        <p style="text-align: left; border: none; padding: 0px; text-decoration: underline;">
         Would output:
        </p>
        <h1 style="color: green;">This is a Heading</h1>

        <p>Inline styles are defined in the anchor tag beginning with the word "style". More than one style can be changed 
            in this inline " style=""" ". Inline styles can be good for styles that are not supposed to be shared with others. 
            For example if we did not want every h1 to be green, then we would use this. If we wanted this header to have a border we could add 
            " style="color: green; border-style:groove" " to give it a grooved border.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another way to implement CSS into your webpage is using internal stylesheet. To do this you would use the "&ltstyle&gt" tag. 
            This next example comes from <a style="color: chartreuse;" href="https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/style-html">bitdegree.org</a>
        </p>

        <img style="padding-left: 5px; width: 800px; height: 300px;" 
        src="/Screen Shot 2021-09-07 at 6.20.22 PM.png" alt="screenshot of inline style code">

        <p>In this exmaple, any h1 tag will output red with a margin of 20px and each p tag will output blue. Internal style sheets 
            would apply to any tag in the style tag unless otherwise specified.
        </p>
